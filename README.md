## Overview
** This project is no longer up and running, due to a lack of maintenance for the past couple of years and the recent changes in the Heroku platform.
Users should be able to:

- Register a new account
- Log in with their account details (username, password)
- Process an image URL, and return the dominant colors that are found in it

### What I learned

This was my first full-stack web application. As such, it was a deep dive into web app setup, reading API and libraries documentation, learning new web technologies and even managing to successfully deploy. It was an amazing learning experience.

This project was originally built with React Class Components. At some point, I converted them all to React Hooks and it was surprisingly easy. The wonders of good documentation!

### Continued development

The signup/login process needs a lot more work with several features, such as:

- Forgot Password
- Verify email after the registration

As for the core functionality, it would be useful to have the option to drag-and-drop images, instead of pasting the URL.

Testing is the thing that I'm mostly looking forward to revisit

And more...
